All the posts from
Wordpress which I wrote in the past have been moved. From now to the end of this year, I
will continue improving the sites. So if you have any suggestion, please let me know. At
the moment, there are still some bugs. Hopefully they will get fixed after I learn better
how Pelican, css and HTML work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this new site, I hope that I can write more frequently. I know I have said the same
thing many times before, but hopefully this time, it will become true.&lt;/p&gt;

Some stories
are told that way. So please do not miss out :) I remember Olga once
asked about it, so in the future I will try my best to release the
photos with captions. Then I will definately select my photos more
carefully to upload each time, since after one weekend trip, definately
more than 400 photos. Well, it is free afterall;-)&lt;/p&gt;
