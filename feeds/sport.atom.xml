One of its most popular and well-known forms is
swimming, cycling and running. One of my new year's resolutions for 2013 is to run a
mini-triathlon. Mini can be 1/8 of an 'iron man' for example, which is 500m swimming,
followed by 22.5km cycling and end with a 5km run. I am not a great planner and I only
started looking for the triathlon competition when summer starts. Consequently,
the one in Nuenen, which is pretty much the only one close by, was already full. However,
in the end, I still managed to get myself registered by contacting the organizer. But it
did not come free since I needed to pay 10 EURO extra and I could only attend the trio
teams, meaning I will have to fill my name 4 times as the team capitan and members of my
own team. Not surprisingly, I named my team 'hahaha'. I just need to teach myself a
lesson that I have to plan better in order to get things done in a normal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I made it with an OK time, see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://s1071.photobucket.com/user/jingjingzou/library/People/Sport-Jing?sort=3&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;photos.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do have to mention again that due to no preparation, it took me triple amount of time
for changing. Nevertheless, it has been great experience. Lesson learnt, I will have a much
better event next year for the 1/4.&lt;/p&gt;

ex-colleagues at Philips asked me to sponsor him for cycling up Alpe
d'Huez to raise money for one of the cancer foundations. Alpe&amp;nbsp;d'Huez is
also part of Tour de France.&amp;nbsp;Then I thought maybe one day I would give
it a try. When chances came, I was just ready to go. Last weekend, a
couple of &amp;nbsp;friends were driving down to Grenoble&amp;nbsp;with one of the plans
being cycling up Alpe d'Huez. It was first time for all of us. We had no
idea how difficult it would be but we kind of knowing it for sure, one
way or another, we would make it to the top. The beginning of the
climbing was difficult, but once I got the rhythm&amp;nbsp;of it, it became
easier and easier and after a little while, I could just continue riding
the bike and left all the guys behind me. Theory proves less weight
helps. As a team, I waited and took the break with the guys and after
some persistence, we all happily made it to the top after cycling 14km
straight up, at the altitude of 1850m. After you made it, it seemed it
was not all that difficult after all. Of course, then you make new
goals. The people who join the fund raising event in summer normally
cycle up and down for 6 times on one day. For that, not just some luck
and try, one will really need to train hard for it. All in all, it was a
nice try. Photos can be seen &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://s1071.photobucket.com/user/jingjingzou/library/Place/Grenoble?sort=3&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time, I have swam for 500m without
a pause. I have no idea since when I could actually do this. Before I
have just never tried it. You will never believe you can do it until you
actually start doing it. So that is my learning for today. Surprising
yourself, that is what you have to do from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, I started working out also, push ups, stretches, jump rope and some
other exercises which I can not even name them. From now on, I just need
to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
