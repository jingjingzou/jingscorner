Wordpress which I wrote in the past have been moved. From now to the end of this year, I
will continue improving the site. So if you have any suggestion, please let me know. At
the moment, there are still some bugs. Hopefully they will get fixed after I learn better
how Pelican, css and html work.</p>
<p>With this new site, I hope that I can write more frequently. I know I have said the same
thing many times before, but hopefully this time, it will become true.</p>
