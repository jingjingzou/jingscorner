:slug: From Wordpress to Github

As it says in the title, today is the grand opening of my new website. All the posts from
Wordpress which I wrote in the past have been moved. From now to the end of this year, I 
will continue improving the sites. So if you have any suggestion, please let me know. At 
the moment, there are still some bugs. Hopefully they will get fixed after I learn better
how Pelican, css and HTML work.

With this new site, I hope that I can write more frequently. I know I have said the same 
thing many times before, but hopefully this time, it will become true.
