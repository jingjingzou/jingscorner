<div class="line">My parents have been living in Ningguo for all their life so far and they</div>
<div class="line">intend to stay in Ningguo for the rest of their life. I moved out of</div>
<div class="line">home when I started university in Shanghai in the year of 1999 and my</div>
<div class="line">sister entered university in 2005.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We have moved 6 times within Ningguo. From a big house in Red Star</div>
<div class="line">village to a tiny semi-attached house in Feng Xing village, where the</div>
<div class="line">steel ball factory my father worked relocated. It is a house but</div>
<div class="line">actually it only has one kitchen and one living room downstairs, and</div>
<div class="line">one bedroom with two beds and a 14-inch colour TV upstairs. I did not</div>
<div class="line">recall any bad memories for staying in this little containment, except</div>
<div class="line">for my sister being kicked out of the bed a few times during the three</div>
<div class="line">years we stayed there. I still vividly remember there were 8 households</div>
<div class="line">in a row and my house was the first in the row. The neighbours are</div>
<div class="line">still very good friends of my family, especially the kids of my</div>
<div class="line">sister’s age.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The living area of the factory was divided into different parts and</div>
<div class="line">each part has one unique type of accommodation, such as the tiny little</div>
<div class="line">double-floor house (step 1), two-bedroom bungalow (step 2), two-bedroom</div>
<div class="line">apartment (step 3), three-bedroom apartment (step 4). The people who</div>
<div class="line">worked in sales were generally better off in the factory so they may</div>
<div class="line">jump in steps starting from step 3. It was like a ladder for my family,</div>
<div class="line">we experienced step 1 to step 3 and then we moved out of the factory</div>
<div class="line">because my father started his own business in 1997. After step 3, we</div>
<div class="line">went back to a similar step 1 again. Because my father quited his job,</div>
<div class="line">we had to move out immediately so we end up in a temporary match box</div>
<div class="line">type compound again. It was simple, just two big rooms so we could be a</div>
<div class="line">bit creative in how to make into a home for four. My parent’s bedroom</div>
<div class="line">occupy one room, and the other we divided it into a kitchen and the</div>
<div class="line">bedroom for me and my sister. The advantage about this accommodation is</div>
<div class="line">that it is in the city center and very close to my school but the</div>
<div class="line">disadvantage is that it is right below a dancing and Karaoke salon,</div>
<div class="line">which normally runs until 1am at earliest. I remembered by then a few</div>
<div class="line">sleepless night for me and my sister. If we were lucky, sometimes a</div>
<div class="line">nice song with a nice tune or close to the tune, but most of time ended</div>
<div class="line">up with some shouting completely out of tune. However, I missed so much</div>
<div class="line">the time when my sister and I went to the small restaurant after my</div>
<div class="line">school at night. We would always spend 5 yuan (50 cents) for a plate of</div>
<div class="line">stir-fried sliced potato and two bows of plain rice or some spicy</div>
<div class="line">noodles before we could go to sleep after the dancing salon stopped its</div>
<div class="line">business.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Time flew as it is now. We moved to our new flat afterwards and my</div>
<div class="line">father’s business of steel ball mold seemed to move on the right track</div>
<div class="line">and most importantly we did not have to suffer midnight shouting</div>
<div class="line">anymore. My father always told us if he had not quited his job in that</div>
<div class="line">factory, he would have never afforded me and my sister both going to</div>
<div class="line">universities. Of course he would not have afforded to built a house for</div>
<div class="line">our family, nor any big purchase he made for the house. Also thanks to</div>
<div class="line">him, I was able to start my adventure in a foreign country via studying</div>
<div class="line">in UK as my first stop. To be honest, I did not mean to break my</div>
<div class="line">promise to my father that I would go back home after my MSc study in</div>
<div class="line">Nano physics, but the study was so short that I simply did not have</div>
<div class="line">enough of it so I stayed for my PhD with financial support from the UK</div>
<div class="line">government and the university, which turned out to be the best choice</div>
<div class="line">so far of my life otherwise this blog would not have existed at the</div>
<div class="line">first place.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I always believe in the butterfly effect, which means a small effect</div>
<div class="line">can lead to a big event in the future. In this case, if Ralf had not</div>
<div class="line">elbowed me in the conference hall when I spontaneously took the sit</div>
<div class="line">next to him, he would not have asked for my hand under the statue at</div>
<div class="line">the far end opposite the Windsor Castle.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That is about it! But of course, I have lots of uncles and aunts and</div>
<div class="line">dozens of cousins and two grandmothers. Amazingly I feel very close to</div>
<div class="line">almost all of them. Guess it is because we all live close together,</div>
<div class="line">which means half an hour at most walking distance. Whenever I go home,</div>
<div class="line">there will be always big get-togethers all the time. One get-together</div>
<div class="line">is never enough, because in China, who initiates the invitation will</div>
<div class="line">pay for the dinner, so everyone wants to take turn to pay, so let us</div>
<div class="line">start counting. My mother’s side has on total 6 siblings, same also at</div>
<div class="line">my father’s side. so on total 12 dinners to go. This is not all, how</div>
<div class="line">about my parents’ friends and our neighbours and my friends.</div>
<div class="line">Invitations come in chains, one chain after another or chain twisted in</div>
<div class="line">another chain, so everyday I or Ralf and I when we go back together,</div>
<div class="line">are booked from lunch to dinner if not breakfast! Since Ralf looks so</div>
<div class="line">different from a normal Chinese, it made us even more popular! What a</div>
<div class="line">phenomenon!</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In China, the elders are mostly supported by their children because</div>
<div class="line">there is almost no pension from the government unless the elder retires</div>
<div class="line">from a job position within a government or from a government-own</div>
<div class="line">factory. Both of my grandmothers have to depend on my parents and all</div>
<div class="line">my uncles as well as my aunts. Fortunately my parents and their</div>
<div class="line">siblings are not doing too bad, but for some elders, it can be a sever</div>
<div class="line">problem. I have seen so many poor eldly people, so I always wanted to</div>
<div class="line">build an eldly home sometime in the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So much about my family. They are all lovely people, I really hope you</div>
<div class="line">will enjoy their company during the wedding.</div>
