</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>My parents have been living in Ningguo for all their life so far and they
intend to stay in Ningguo for the rest of their life. I moved out of
home when I started university in Shanghai in the year of 1999 and my
sister entered university in 2005.</p>
<p>We have moved 6 times within Ningguo. From a big house in Red Star
village to a tiny semi-attached house in Feng Xing village, where the
steel ball factory my father worked relocated. It is a house but
actually it only has one kitchen and one living room downstairs, and
one bedroom with two beds and a 14-inch colour TV upstairs. I did not
recall any bad memories for staying in this little containment, except
for my sister being kicked out of the bed a few times during the three
years we stayed there. I still vividly remember there were 8 households
in a row and my house was the first in the row. The neighbours are
still very good friends of my family, especially the kids of my
sister’s age.</p>
<p>The living area of the factory was divided into different parts and
each part has one unique type of accommodation, such as the tiny little
double-floor house (step 1), two-bedroom bungalow (step 2), two-bedroom
apartment (step 3), three-bedroom apartment (step 4). The people who
worked in sales were generally better off in the factory so they may
jump in steps starting from step 3. It was like a ladder for my family,
we experienced step 1 to step 3 and then we moved out of the factory
because my father started his own business in 1997. After step 3, we
went back to a similar step 1 again. Because my father quited his job,
we had to move out immediately so we end up in a temporary match box
type compound again. It was simple, just two big rooms so we could be a
bit creative in how to make into a home for four. My parent’s bedroom
occupy one room, and the other we divided it into a kitchen and the
bedroom for me and my sister. The advantage about this accommodation is
that it is in the city center and very close to my school but the
disadvantage is that it is right below a dancing and Karaoke salon,
which normally runs until 1am at earliest. I remembered by then a few
sleepless night for me and my sister. If we were lucky, sometimes a
nice song with a nice tune or close to the tune, but most of time ended
up with some shouting completely out of tune. However, I missed so much
the time when my sister and I went to the small restaurant after my
school at night. We would always spend 5 yuan (50 cents) for a plate of
stir-fried sliced potato and two bows of plain rice or some spicy
noodles before we could go to sleep after the dancing salon stopped its
business.</p>
<p>Time flew as it is now. We moved to our new flat afterwards and my
father’s business of steel ball mold seemed to move on the right track
and most importantly we did not have to suffer midnight shouting
anymore. My father always told us if he had not quited his job in that
factory, he would have never afforded me and my sister both going to
universities. Of course he would not have afforded to built a house for
our family, nor any big purchase he made for the house. Also thanks to
him, I was able to start my adventure in a foreign country via studying
in UK as my first stop. To be honest, I did not mean to break my
promise to my father that I would go back home after my MSc study in
Nano physics, but the study was so short that I simply did not have
enough of it so I stayed for my PhD with financial support from the UK
government and the university, which turned out to be the best choice
so far of my life otherwise this blog would not have existed at the
first place.</p>
<p>I always believe in the butterfly effect, which means a small effect
can lead to a big event in the future. In this case, if Ralf had not
elbowed me in the conference hall when I spontaneously took the sit
next to him, he would not have asked for my hand under the statue at
the far end opposite the Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>That is about it! But of course, I have lots of uncles and aunts and
dozens of cousins and two grandmothers. Amazingly I feel very close to
almost all of them. Guess it is because we all live close together,
which means half an hour at most walking distance. Whenever I go home,
there will be always big get-togethers all the time. One get-together
is never enough, because in China, who initiates the invitation will
pay for the dinner, so everyone wants to take turn to pay, so let us
start counting. My mother’s side has on total 6 siblings, same also at
my father’s side. so on total 12 dinners to go. This is not all, how
about my parents’ friends and our neighbours and my friends.
Invitations come in chains, one chain after another or chain twisted in
another chain, so everyday I or Ralf and I when we go back together,
are booked from lunch to dinner if not breakfast! Since Ralf looks so
different from a normal Chinese, it made us even more popular! What a
phenomenon!</p>
<p>In China, the elders are mostly supported by their children because
there is almost no pension from the government unless the elder retires
from a job position within a government or from a government-own
factory. Both of my grandmothers have to depend on my parents and all
my uncles as well as my aunts. Fortunately my parents and their
siblings are not doing too bad, but for some elders, it can be a sever
problem. I have seen so many poor eldly people, so I always wanted to
build an eldly home sometime in the future.</p>
<p>So much about my family. They are all lovely people, I really hope you
will enjoy their company during the wedding.</p>
