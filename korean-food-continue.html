</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>There are certain things I am not sure I would ever want to try even
though I was bragging about my boldness all the time:)</p>
<p>Somehow Koreans like to eat things raw, just like japanese or the other
way around depending whether I am talking to a Korean or a Japanese:-)</p>
<p>Sashimi, which is a must have delicasy along the coast. However, if I
google Sashimi on Wikipedia, and it reads as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Sashimi</strong> is a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_cuisine">Japanese delicacy</a> primarily consisting of very fresh
raw <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood">seafood</a>, sliced into thin pieces about 2.5cm (1.0in.) wide by
4.0cm (1.5in.) long by 0.5 cm (0.25in.) thick, but dimensions vary
depending on the type of item and chef, and served with only a dipping
sauce (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_sauce">soy sauce</a> with <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasabi">wasabi</a> paste and thinly-sliced <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger">ginger</a>
root or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzu">ponzu</a>), and a simple garnish such as <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perilla">shiso</a> and shredded
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikon">daikon</a> radish.</p>
<p>Many Korean still believe Japanese copied from them, but I guess most of
people around the world recognize Sashimi is Japanese. Well, I indeed
asked some Koreans that whether there is a difference. However, there
are indeed some difference. I am trying to summarize from what I have
observed/experienced and also heard from others:</p>
<p>1) Koreans like to have the raw fish really fresh, which means they
donot even want the fish to be marinated too long in the air. Being
fresh to another extend that, they would rather eat it alive or just
about to pass away or just passed away, for example, most restaurants
prepare the fish (not even sure some of them even belong to fish,
because they look so ugly and strange!) just after you have chosen it or
them from the fish tank. In other words, you made a very wise choice to
deliver them to heaven via a shortcut. The most common eat-it-raw is the
jumping octopus. I have never seen it myself and I am not sure I have
the guts to try it anyway. However, I was told what is actually served
commonly is just the tails of octopus. However, due to 'certain
electricity', those tails are still jumping even though they are
deprived of their main body. Once you bite into it, they immediately
surrend to your teath! Believe it or not, most of people who have ever
had it all told me it is indeed very delicious. If this is not scaring
enough, it does happen that someone just starts biting on the whole
alive octopus, which really makes me shiver when I start imagine it!!
But I do dare to see it if someone dares to try it! So far enough for
Korean sashimi, the only thing I know about Japanese Sashimi, is that it
is a little bit less fresh since Japanese like to eat it when it is aged
in a bit after its death.</p>
<p>2) I am not totally sure this point is true, but I assume it is true for
now since I have never been to Japan. Koreans seem to eat all kinds of
raw fish even the innards. I have heard that the fishmen sometimes make
big efforts to catch fish from the deep sea, which is a very good sell
in the market. The very common innards served as a starter or part of
the fish plate is from sea cucumber or sea pineapple. To be honest, I
have seen sea pineapples in the market but I took it as some kind of
orange plants which grow underearth. Strange!</p>
<p>3) Koreans sashimi is served with fresh lettice. So the standard way is
to dip the sliced fish in the soysource mixed with wasabi or chili
source and wrap it in the lettice with a piece of raw garlic or chopped
garlic and a piece of green chili. But Japanese sashimi is only served
with soysource and wasabi. Of course another huge difference is that in
general what ever you have for the main food, it always comes with tons
of various sashimi. Amazing enough, the kimchi which comes before Korean
sachimi, are mainly made with fish, all kinds of fish marinated with
spicy sources. Also, after the main meal, it comes the spicy fish soup
(more like a stock), which is normally made with the leftover fish and
many types of vegs. It is very delicious!</p>
<p>4) I am sure there are some other differences but I have it caught it so
far! I will follow up on it once I find out more about it.</p>
<p>I mentioned Koreans eat it raw, and not just fish though. I have seen
people consume raw beaf, also sliced. The more rare ones are raw liver
(not sure which animal though), also raw horse meat. I heard that some
town is specially famous for serving raw horse meat and it is actually
served with affordable price. Nevertheless, I am not really interested
on this one. Unless, someone, who tells me that he or she wants to eat a
whole horse, wants to keep me accompany:)</p>
<p>Done with Korean food for now. I have more important things to tell
later.</p>
