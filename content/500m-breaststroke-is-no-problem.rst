Today I went swimming. For the first time, I have swam for 500m without
a pause. I have no idea since when I could actually do this. Before I
have just never tried it. You will never believe you can do it until you
actually start doing it. So that is my learning for today. Surprising
yourself, that is what you have to do from time to time.

BTW, I started working out also, push ups, stretches, jump rope and some
other exercises which I can not even name them. From now on, I just need
to keep it up.
