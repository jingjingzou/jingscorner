About
#####

My name is Jing Zou. I am from China and currently live in 
Eindhoven, the Netherlands. I like writing random things, 
thoughts down. Emotion fluctuates, thought varies, view changes, 
memory leaks, life continues with complexity remains.

To share, to laugh, to think, to live. I share my corner and you 
share your world with me.
