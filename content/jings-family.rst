|  My parents have been living in Ningguo for all their life so far and they
|  intend to stay in Ningguo for the rest of their life. I moved out of
|  home when I started university in Shanghai in the year of 1999 and my
|  sister entered university in 2005.

|  We have moved 6 times within Ningguo. From a big house in Red Star
|  village to a tiny semi-attached house in Feng Xing village, where the
|  steel ball factory my father worked relocated. It is a house but
|  actually it only has one kitchen and one living room downstairs, and
|  one bedroom with two beds and a 14-inch colour TV upstairs. I did not
|  recall any bad memories for staying in this little containment, except
|  for my sister being kicked out of the bed a few times during the three
|  years we stayed there. I still vividly remember there were 8 households
|  in a row and my house was the first in the row. The neighbours are
|  still very good friends of my family, especially the kids of my
|  sister’s age.

|  The living area of the factory was divided into different parts and
|  each part has one unique type of accommodation, such as the tiny little
|  double-floor house (step 1), two-bedroom bungalow (step 2), two-bedroom
|  apartment (step 3), three-bedroom apartment (step 4). The people who
|  worked in sales were generally better off in the factory so they may
|  jump in steps starting from step 3. It was like a ladder for my family,
|  we experienced step 1 to step 3 and then we moved out of the factory
|  because my father started his own business in 1997. After step 3, we
|  went back to a similar step 1 again. Because my father quited his job,
|  we had to move out immediately so we end up in a temporary match box
|  type compound again. It was simple, just two big rooms so we could be a
|  bit creative in how to make into a home for four. My parent’s bedroom
|  occupy one room, and the other we divided it into a kitchen and the
|  bedroom for me and my sister. The advantage about this accommodation is
|  that it is in the city center and very close to my school but the
|  disadvantage is that it is right below a dancing and Karaoke salon,
|  which normally runs until 1am at earliest. I remembered by then a few
|  sleepless night for me and my sister. If we were lucky, sometimes a
|  nice song with a nice tune or close to the tune, but most of time ended
|  up with some shouting completely out of tune. However, I missed so much
|  the time when my sister and I went to the small restaurant after my
|  school at night. We would always spend 5 yuan (50 cents) for a plate of
|  stir-fried sliced potato and two bows of plain rice or some spicy
|  noodles before we could go to sleep after the dancing salon stopped its
|  business.

|  Time flew as it is now. We moved to our new flat afterwards and my
|  father’s business of steel ball mold seemed to move on the right track
|  and most importantly we did not have to suffer midnight shouting
|  anymore. My father always told us if he had not quited his job in that
|  factory, he would have never afforded me and my sister both going to
|  universities. Of course he would not have afforded to built a house for
|  our family, nor any big purchase he made for the house. Also thanks to
|  him, I was able to start my adventure in a foreign country via studying
|  in UK as my first stop. To be honest, I did not mean to break my
|  promise to my father that I would go back home after my MSc study in
|  Nano physics, but the study was so short that I simply did not have
|  enough of it so I stayed for my PhD with financial support from the UK
|  government and the university, which turned out to be the best choice
|  so far of my life otherwise this blog would not have existed at the
|  first place.

|  I always believe in the butterfly effect, which means a small effect
|  can lead to a big event in the future. In this case, if Ralf had not
|  elbowed me in the conference hall when I spontaneously took the sit
|  next to him, he would not have asked for my hand under the statue at
|  the far end opposite the Windsor Castle.

|  That is about it! But of course, I have lots of uncles and aunts and
|  dozens of cousins and two grandmothers. Amazingly I feel very close to
|  almost all of them. Guess it is because we all live close together,
|  which means half an hour at most walking distance. Whenever I go home,
|  there will be always big get-togethers all the time. One get-together
|  is never enough, because in China, who initiates the invitation will
|  pay for the dinner, so everyone wants to take turn to pay, so let us
|  start counting. My mother’s side has on total 6 siblings, same also at
|  my father’s side. so on total 12 dinners to go. This is not all, how
|  about my parents’ friends and our neighbours and my friends.
|  Invitations come in chains, one chain after another or chain twisted in
|  another chain, so everyday I or Ralf and I when we go back together,
|  are booked from lunch to dinner if not breakfast! Since Ralf looks so
|  different from a normal Chinese, it made us even more popular! What a
|  phenomenon!

|  In China, the elders are mostly supported by their children because
|  there is almost no pension from the government unless the elder retires
|  from a job position within a government or from a government-own
|  factory. Both of my grandmothers have to depend on my parents and all
|  my uncles as well as my aunts. Fortunately my parents and their
|  siblings are not doing too bad, but for some elders, it can be a sever
|  problem. I have seen so many poor eldly people, so I always wanted to
|  build an eldly home sometime in the future.

| So much about my family. They are all lovely people, I really hope you
| will enjoy their company during the wedding.
