Well first I'll say hi to everyone, since this is my first post and I'm
happy to share Jing's blog. Now on topic: do you want some great free
music? Then go `here`_. **Magnatune** is a great music site, I've bought
several albums from them already. Now they've decided to give an album
away for free each month, so try it and download if you like it! Also,
if you buy anything you can legally give three more copies away to your
friends. So if you read this leave a comment and you're next on the list
for that:)

Well it's almost weekend, so I'm off to play badminton with Jing and
some friends. And maybe make a trip to Windsor. And enjoy one of the
last weekends we'll have here in the UK (which is good and bad at the
same time)......
