Ralf is in sleep now. By now I automatically deduct my time by 6 hours.
We talked everyday so far, and I am all alone so is he. We both have to
make new friends and build up a new social circle. However, I am not in
a hurry, just have too much to do at the moment.

I am definitely not freaked out by the distance yet. Well, I know it is
a daring comment because we have been only apart for 4 days.
But amazingly, lots of small sweet details traced back from time to time
in my mind. Is the distance a trigger I am not so sure, but I like the
feelings. It was much harder for me before he left and for now I just
have to accept it.
