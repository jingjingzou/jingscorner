The title may sound strange but does really everyone in this world know
how to live. I am certainly the exception. We were born for life. Some
people strive for life, some people live the life but other people live
just because they are alive. If I am really bitter about myself, I fit
into the last category better.

From the first day of life, there is the genuine cruel unfairness,
materialistically  or mentally. Based on what I have experienced and
observed, people generally know to how to live better when they are
materialistically satisfied. It makes sense, when you are struggling to
live (to maintain your body in shape), you will not have left-over
energy to live better. Most of people in developing countries live in
this way, including some of my beloved families. They including me, are
used to strive for life because they were born and raised this way. I am
far more satisfied materialistically but still how can I live better?

It is possible to learn to drive, to speak a foreign language, to play
tennis, to learn whatever other people have done, but how can we learn
how to live. People's life are made and there is no ideal model
but inevitaly people influence each other. I appreciate some people's
way of life but simply I can not live like that because I do not own
that kind of mind set. Something growing deeply in me would not let me.

To suffer, to enjoy, to learn...
