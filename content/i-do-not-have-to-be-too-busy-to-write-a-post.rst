As you can tell that this blog is not updated again for sometime. Being
busy is such a grand excuse I always give myself. Really, I do not have
to be so busy and all the time I feel so hectic but on what? I do have
to learn tons of stuff but there will be never an end. Slow down the
pace, maybe everything will look better, who knows!

As for Xmas present, my best gift will be a method to gain wisdom.

Come back later, feeling cold now.

I am going to learn Dutch on TV in bed!

(Sorry for this crap post, promise will write something nice soon.)
