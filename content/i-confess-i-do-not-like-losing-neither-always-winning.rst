Physics badminton is expanding. Originally I have got together four
people and played on a weekly basis. Now we have 8 people playing on two
courts and 2 to 3 times a week. It is not the first time I realize I do
not like losing. My nerve naturally gets tightened when I am on a losing
track and I can not even squeeze a smile out of my face. People must
have believed I am far too serious. It is not a pleasant feeling but the
thing I am concerned most is that it may not be pleasant for others. On
the other hand, when Aya and me played as the Asian team, we always won
over the European team: Michele and Ben. I definitely lost interest
after a little while because it was not enough challenge. The right
altitude I believe should be: Feel rejoiced when winning; control better
when losing. Afterall, no failure, no progress! Just like No pain, No
gain.

I do not wish to be a bad loser!
