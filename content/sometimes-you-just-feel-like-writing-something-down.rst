It has been a long time that I actually start writing something down. It
did occur to me a few times before that I wanted to write something down
to reflect upon what I had been doing, but it did not happen. 

So actually I am pretty happy to find out my wordpress account still
works, which offers means when I do want to record something. 

I often say to people 'that is really cool and I want to do it too
someday'. I have a lot of 'wants'. Sometimes I will just have to
translate the 'want' into actions, then it actually can become true.
Looking at my progress of keeping up the goals I set this year for
myself over the first quarter, I would say I have had a slow start so
far. The good thing is that I shall still look forward. With the weather
getting better and the day getting longer, I will have much more passion
to do more sports outside. So it is not yet too late to catch up. Easier
said than done, I will just have to check up on myself once in a while. 

See you all later.
