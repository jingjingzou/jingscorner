New era, new plans!

There are so many things I always wanted to do and did not manage to do
them well, such as tennis, guitar, Spanish, Dutch and Swimming. I will
have to learn Dutch well since I will be living there since October. I
will have to learn swimming well since I was nearly drowned in the sea.
I will have to learn guitar well, since I always wish to impress Ralf
with my music. Spanish, since I always wish to travel around the world!
