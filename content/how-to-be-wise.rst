Some people are under endless pursuit all life long, but what are they
after? What I am after?

I want to gain wisdom over life, since I rejoice when I am capable of
delivering wise opinions, having peculiar views. But how? People say
traveling will definitely broaden your views, which is what I am doing
now, but what if I am a blind traveller, what if what I observe is
superficial, what if I see is not even the truth?

Simply absorbing the existent knowledge will not bring the wisdom since
facts are just facts and history will not normally get back on the same
track. Giving the same knowledge, different people process the
information in different ways, resulting in differing opinions. Some are
wiser than others. Why?

The first time I heard of people wishing for wisdom was at a birthday
party of a woman I encountered when I went to Berlin. She met me on the
plane and offered to drive me to the institue and I happily acceped her
help. Afterwards I was invited for her birthday party. She was around 50
and she said she wants wisdom and that is all what she wants for her
age. It sounded really funny to me at the time, since I am wondering
what is really wisdom? But now I want it too, for my age ...
